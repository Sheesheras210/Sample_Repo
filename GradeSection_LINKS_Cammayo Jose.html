		<h3>Paragraph 1</h3>
			<p>four score and seven years ago our brought for on this continent a new nation, concieved in Liberty, and dedicated to the preposition that all men are created equal.</p>
		<h3>Paragraph 2</h3>
		<p>Now we are engaged in a real civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so concieved and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place fort those who here gave their lives so that that nation might live. I5 is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this </p>
		<h3>Paragraph 3</h3>
		<p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate-we can not consecrate-we can not hallow-this ground. The brave men, living and deas, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say herem but it fan never forget what they did here, It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fhought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolvd that these ded shall not have died in vain-- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth that government of the people, by the peoplem for the people, shall not perish from the earth. </p>
